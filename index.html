            <h2 class="section-two__title">About Me</h2>
            <p class="section-two__desc"> I am excited to be here today. I recently completed my studies in commerce,
                where I gained a solid understanding of business principles, finance, and marketing. However, I have
                always had a passion for technology and creativity, which has led me to make a significant career shift
                into web development.

                I am currently in the process of learning essential web development skills, including HTML, CSS, and
                JavaScript. I am particularly interested in front-end development because I enjoy creating visually
                appealing and user-friendly interfaces. I believe that my background in commerce gives me a unique
                perspective on how to design websites that not only look good but also serve business needs effectively.

                In addition to my technical skills, I am a strong communicator and a team player, which I believe are
                crucial in the tech industry. I enjoy collaborating with others and sharing ideas to create innovative
                solutions.

                I am eager to build my portfolio by working on real-world projects and contributing to open-source
                initiatives. I am also actively seeking internships or entry-level positions where I can apply my skills
                and continue to learn from experienced professionals.

                In my free time, I love exploring new technologies, reading about industry trends, and participating in
                online coding challenges to sharpen my skills.
